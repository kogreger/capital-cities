# Capital Cities Research Project (Urban Mobility)

This is the GitHub repository for an ongoing research project at the Division for Spatial Information Science (SIS) at the University of Tsukuba. Project lead is [Prof. Yuji Murayama](http://giswin.geo.tsukuba.ac.jp/teacher/murayama/index-e.htm). The research project itself is divided into two sub-projects:
* Urban Land Use - PI: Dr. Ronald C. Estoque
* Urban Mobility - PI: [Konstantin Greger](http://www.konstantingreger.net)

This GitHub repository contains only information about the Urban Mobility sub-project.
